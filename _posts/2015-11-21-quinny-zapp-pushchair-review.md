# Quinny Zapp Pushchair Review

> It can also be made into a travel system from birth by clipping on a Maxi Cosi carseat.
> 
> This revolutionary new Dutch design from Quinny, the Zapp is the smallest buggy ever made. Whilst it loses none of the practicalities of a full size buggy its so small it will fit in the foot well of your car. Perfect for traveling in cars and trains and will fold up so small for those plane trips abroad, you can even carry it on your bicycle! It has suspension on all three wheels ensuring a comfortable ride. It can also be made into a travel system from birth by clipping on a Maxi Cosi carseat. It comes complete with raincover and sun canopy and its own colour coordinated bag. This buggy is a must for all those school runs with its striking stylish good looks, making it a real head turner.
