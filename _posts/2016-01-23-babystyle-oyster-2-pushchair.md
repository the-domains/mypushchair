> Striking and stylish... one of the most popular pushchairs on the market today

The Babystyle Oyster 2 is a striking and stylish pushchair. It is forward and rear facing stroller and is both compact and sturdy. This pushchair is suitable from Birth to around 3 years of age and can be easily transformed into a travel system by adding the Britax SHR, Maxi-Cosi CabrioFix and BeSafe iZi Go car seats with separate adaptors. With a multi-position recline this means great comfort for baby. A reversible seat, so either forward or rear-facing. The Oyster 2 stroller is great for use on public transport as it has a rather narrow width, being only about 55cm wheel to wheel. Great for fitting into smaller cars and storage at home, for example in a porch.

Choose your chassis, which includes Includes: Smooth black seat unit (with integral insect net), leatherette handle and bumper bar, high shine wheels along with shopping basket and raincover. Then add a seat unit colour pack, which comprises: Colour co-ordinated hood, seat liner, car seat head hugger, apron and carrybag. There is also a carrycot option and a carrycot colour pack.
