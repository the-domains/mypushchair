# Choosing a pushchair...

> Is always a personal choice but it is not always as simple as it sounds. 

There are a lot of different options to pick between and it's worth taking some time to make sure you get the right one to suit you and your needs. There are many factors to take into consideration and making the right choice will benefit both you and your child. The colour of the pushchair you select is a personal choice but the type and style of pushchair should be governed by your needs.

## Points to consider:

Is the pushchair too heavy for your needs? Handle height and grip position is it comfortable to push? Size when folded, does it have a carrying handle? Will it fit in your car boot when folded? Is it light enough for your needs? Does it have one handed easy fold mechanism? Will it be suitable for public transport e.g. hopping on and off buses? Manoeuvrability, does it turn easily? Does it have the necessary back support for your baby if under 6 months?Is it comfortable for baby? Good suspension makes it a smoother ride for you and your baby. Is it sturdy enough for baby and your needs do you need an all terrain mountain buggy? Has it got a basket for baby's things and is it large enough for your needs?
