The Stylish Joolz pushchair has everything parents need for a new baby. It comes with carrycot, shopping basket, pushchair seat, raincover and chassis. The high seat position of the Joolz pushchair puts less strain on your back, and the compact fold makes the pushchair easy to store. With 4-wheel suspension ensuring your baby has a comfortable ride, the Joolz ergonomically designed seat can be adjusted and reversed into three different positions. The comfortable carrycot has a hypo-allergenic breathable mattress that's also suitable for sleeping at night, useful for occasional overnight sleeping at friends or relatives.

This amazing pram/pushchair is also compatible with the following car seats: Maxi-Cosi Pebble, Maxi-Cosi Cabriofix, BeSafe iZi Go and Cybex Aton.
