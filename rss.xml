            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Types of Pushchairs</h1><p>The three wheeler pushchair: Looks trendy, a great pushchair to have especially if you live near the countryside and do a lot of walking. They are not usually suitable from birth although you can get attachments to adapt them. They are very easy to steer. May be heavy and bulky when folded down and you need to consider if it will fit in your car boot.</p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Babystyle Oyster 2 Pushchair]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Babystyle Oyster 2 Pushchair</h1><p>The Babystyle Oyster 2 is a striking and stylish pushchair. It is forward and rear facing stroller and is both compact and sturdy. This pushchair is suitable from Birth to around 3 years of age and can be easily transformed into a travel system by adding the Britax SHR, Maxi-Cosi CabrioFix and BeSafe iZi Go car seats with separate adaptors. With a multi-position recline this means great comfort for baby. A reversible seat, so either forward or rear-facing. The Oyster 2 stroller is great for use on public transport as it has a rather narrow width, being only about 55cm wheel to wheel. Great for fitting into smaller cars and storage at home, for example in a porch.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e0eb75dc0be8da735eba2efcef140556fe217a93.jpg"></article>]]></description>
