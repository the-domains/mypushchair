            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Babystyle Oyster 2 Pushchair</h1><p>The Babystyle Oyster 2 is a striking and stylish pushchair. It is forward and rear facing stroller and is both compact and sturdy. This pushchair is suitable from Birth to around 3 years of age and can be easily transformed into a travel system by adding the Britax SHR, Maxi-Cosi CabrioFix and BeSafe iZi Go car seats with separate adaptors. With a multi-position recline this means great comfort for baby. A reversible seat, so either forward or rear-facing. The Oyster 2 stroller is great for use on public transport as it has a rather narrow width, being only about 55cm wheel to wheel. Great for fitting into smaller cars and storage at home, for example in a porch.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e0eb75dc0be8da735eba2efcef140556fe217a93.jpg"></article>]]></description>
